# AoC 2020 Idris

## What is this?

This is my repository for solving [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/) in Idris.

## Why is x day not on here?

I probably didn't solve it yet. I just started learning Idris a few days before the event, so I might not have been able to solve all the puzzles. If you want the rest of the days, I am solving all the puzzles [here in TypeScript.](https://github.com/xWafl/aoc-2020-ts)

## Why are there a bunch of folders with 1 thing in them?

They actually have more on my end, I just gitignored most stuff out. This includes my puzzle input, compiled files, and emacs files.

## How do I run this?

Put your input into `input.txt`, in the same directory as the solution you want. Make sure not to leave a newline at the end.
